## Biological Background

### Neurons and Neural Networks

Neurons are the fundamental computational units of the nervous system, responsible for processing and transmitting information through electrical and chemical signals. A typical neuron consists of:

- **Soma (Cell Body)**: Contains the nucleus and most organelles, integrates incoming signals
- **Dendrites**: Branching extensions that receive synaptic inputs from other neurons
- **Axon**: Long projection that transmits action potentials ("outputs") to target neurons
- **Synapses**: Specialized junctions where neurons communicate via neurotransmitters

### Action Potentials and Membrane Dynamics

The electrical activity of neurons is governed by the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The membrane potential (voltage difference across the membrane) changes dynamically due to:

1. **Ion Channels**: Proteins that allow specific ions to pass through the membrane
2. **Ion Pumps**: Active transporters that maintain ion concentration gradients
3. **Membrane Capacitance**: The membrane's ability to store electrical charge

### Multi-Compartment Models

Real (biological) neurons are not electrically uniform structures. Different parts of a neuron (soma, dendrites, axon) have different electrical properties and channel distributions. This allows for modeling multiple scales, as is illustrated by the following image taken from Dayan & Abbott (2001):

Multi-compartment models divide neurons into discrete segments, each with its own:

- Membrane capacitance and resistance
- Ion channel densities
- Morphological properties (length, diameter)
- Electrical coupling to neighboring compartments

This approach allows realistic modeling of:
- **Dendritic Integration**: How synaptic inputs from other neurons are processed in the dendrites
- **Action Potential Propagation**: How spikes travel along axons *(if an axon is modeled consisting of multiple compartments)*
- **Spatial Summation**: How inputs from different locations combine
- **Temporal Dynamics**: How signals change over time and space

### Cable Theory

Cable theory provides a mathematical foundation for understanding electrical signal propagation in neurons. An estimation is made by modeling dendrites and axons as cylinders *("cable")* composed of segments. So it basically treats neuronal processes as electrical cables with:

- **Axial Resistance ($R_a$)**: Resistance to current flow along the process
- **Membrane Resistance ($R_m$)**: Resistance to current flow across the membrane
- **Membrane Capacitance ($C_m$)**: Ability to store electrical charge

The cable equation describes how voltage changes propagate:

$$ c_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{2ar_L} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( a^2 \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} \right) - i_m + i_e$$


Where:
- $c_m$ is membrane capacitance
- $V$ is membrane potential
- $a$ is cable radius
- $r_L$ is axial resistance (=longitudinal)
- $i_m$ is membrane current density
- $i_e$ is external current density
- $x$ is cable distance


## Mathematical Foundations

### Hodgkin-Huxley Model

Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley introduced a mathematical framework for modeling ionic currents of excitable membranes that has become standard. It describes the ionic mechanisms underlying action potential generation. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a system of four ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

#### Membrane Current Equation

$$ C \frac{dV}{dt} = I_{app} - I_{Na_V} - I_{K_V} - I_L$$

Where:
- $C$ is Membrane capacitance
- $I_{app}$ is applied current
- $I_{Na_V}$ is sodium current
- $I_{K_V}$ is potassium current  
- $I_L$ is passive leak current

#### Ionic Currents

**Sodium Current:**

$$ I_{Na_V} = g_{Na} m^3 h (V - E_{Na}) $$

**Potassium Current:**

$$ I_{K_V} = g_K n^4 (V - E_K) $$

**Leak Current:**

$$ I_L = g_L (V - E_L) $$

Where:
- $g_{Na}$, $g_K$, $g_L$: Maximum conductances
- $E_{Na}$, $E_K$, $E_L$: Reversal potentials
- $m$, $h$, $n$: Gating variables ($0 \le m$, $h$, $n \le 1$)

#### Gating Variable Dynamics
The transition of each subunit gate can be described by a kinetic scheme, in which the gating transition *closed → open* occurs at a voltage-dependent rate $\alpha_n(V)$, and the reverse transition *open → closed*, occurs at a voltage dependent rate $\beta_n(V)$.

So the gating variables follow first-order kinetics:

$$ \frac{dn}{dt} = \alpha_n(V) (1 - n) - \beta_n(V) n $$


Where $n$ *= (m, h, n)*, $\alpha_n$, and $\beta_n$ are voltage-dependent rate constants:

**Sodium activation (m):**

$$ \alpha_m = \frac{0.1 (V + 40)}{1 - exp(-0.1 (V + 40))} $$

$$ \beta_m = 4 exp(-0.0556 (V + 65)) $$

**Sodium inactivation (h):**

$$ \alpha_h = 0.07 exp(-0.05 (V + 65)) $$

$$ \beta_h = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-0.1 (V + 35))} $$

**Potassium activation (n):**

$$ \alpha_n = \frac{0.01 (V + 55)}{1 - exp(-0.1 (V + 55))} $$

$$ \beta_n = 0.125 exp(-0.0125 (V + 65)) $$

#### Hodgkin-Huxley Dynamics
A graphical visualization of the temporal evolution of the dynamic variables of the Hodgkin-HUxley model during a single action potential is shown below:

The upper-most trace is the membrane potential, the second is the membrane current produced by the sum of the Hodgkin-Huxley $K^+$ and $Na^+$ conductances. Subsequent traces show the temporal evolution of $m$, $h$, and $n$. Current injection was initiated at t=5ms. Dayan & Abbott (2001)
